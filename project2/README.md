### Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge
In this second Data Science project from the General Assembly curriculum, I examined the Ames Housing data that was provided. The aim for this project was to create a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset, which the model will predict the price of a house at sale. Furthermore, I would also identify key attributes which have signifcant effect on the price of a house. The derived model would then be used to predict the given test data by Kaggle, which would return a root mean square error metrics as a model performance measure.

The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.

### Issues with provided data
---
- There are pockets of missing in the dataset, and some columns name are not spelt the same as the data documentation provided online (available as DataDocumentation.txt)
- There are entries which are not spelt the same as what is described by the data documentation. 

### Summary of Findings & Recommendations
Lasso has by far has the best test RMSE value at 33407. With 40 features made up of 24 numerical features and 16 categorical features expanded from 3 original categorical features, it is now more ideal and easy to explain to relevant stakeholders. Ideally, we would always prefer to have a model that is complex enough to fit all the points but yet could simply be explained.

Additionally, the Lasso regression model does not look to be overfitted given that it has a slightly higher training RMSE value compared to Ridge regression.

Looking at the absolute values of the coefficients from the Lasso Model, we see that the heating quality and condition plays a key feature in determining the house price with a coefficient of 25223. The next few key features would be total porch area and wood deck area with coefficients of -21617 and 13352 respectively.

It is no doubt that heating quality and condition plays a significant part for Iowa citizens as it could be as cold as -10Â°C. Furthermore, given the state history of encountering floods in the past which are caused by rapid snow melt and heavy summer rainstorms, it is undeniable that Iowa citizens would place more emphasis on heating quatlity and condition for their home.

It is interesting to note that larger porch area actually reduces the property price. A possible explanation could be due to its past experiences with natural disasters which tends to destroy or damage house property, hence causing damages to porch which costs on average USD10000 to USD20000 for rebuilding, thus widely frowned upon by buyers(ref: https://www.fixr.com/costs/porch-addition).

At number three, the wood deck area of the property takes the spot and is no surprise that wood decks helps provides comfort & is heat-resistant which is good during the summer days which are long, warm, humid, which could be a possible reason why it is preferred 

Therefore, we can conclude that the heating quality and condition, total porch area and wood deck area are key features in affecting the property price.
